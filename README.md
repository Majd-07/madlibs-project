## What is Mad Libs? 
 
Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

Mad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", "celebrity," "Exclamation" or "part of the body".[11] One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical.
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs).

In normal mad libs, you usually just insert the word, but in this version, it's more like a "fill in the blank" of an existing story.
